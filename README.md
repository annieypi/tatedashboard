# tatedashboard
This repository contains a final dashboard developed in Tableau, based on an open dataset from the Tate Modern museum in London. This dataset contained information on roughly 68,000 artworks and 3,000 artists. Before creating the dashboard, the data was cleaned and loaded into MySQL Server using ETL processes. 

This dashboard was developed for a curator perspective to explore and understand the museum's collection at a glance. Both the Tableau extract file and a PDF are included to view the dashboard.
